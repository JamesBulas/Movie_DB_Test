# Something Interesting or Significant
I feel like the most significant part of the project was getting all the different API calls to work together with not too much time spent.

# Most Pleased with
I think I am most pleased with finishing the project in a good amount of time, and everything seems to be working as expected.

# Things Left to Add
If I were to continue on this project, I would like to spend some time cleanig up the code a bit, as well as seperating some pieces into smaller components to make it easier to go back and work with. I'd also like to add unit tests.
